# Hannah's Dotfiles

Here is where I keep and maintain my dotfiles so that when my computer breaks I don't have to start over setup!

## Symlinking

Since my dotfiles are updated in this repo but sourced outside of it, I symlink them to ~ using the following command
`ln -sv ~/dotfiles/.bash_profile ~`
so that when I make changes, they are automatically reflected on my local machine.
